# Two-Digit Sum and Square - Assembly Program

### Explanation:

This assembly program takes a two-digit number as input from the user, calculates the sum of its digits, and then computes and displays the square of the sum.

Here's how the program works step by step:

1. The program starts with the `_start` label, which serves as the entry point for the program.

2. The `inputmessage` subroutine is called to display a message asking the user to enter a two-digit number. It uses the `msg` string and prints it using the `int 80h` system call.

3. The `input` subroutine is called to read the user input. It reads two characters (digits) using the `int 0x80` system call and stores the input in the `inp` buffer.

4. The `convert` subroutine converts the ASCII characters of the two digits into an actual numeric value. It subtracts `30h` (ASCII value of '0') from the ASCII values of the digits and then multiplies and adds them to form the numeric value.

5. The `sum` loop calculates the sum of the two digits by adding them together repeatedly using the `add` instruction and `loop` control structure.

6. The `breakdigits` loop is responsible for breaking down the sum into individual digits and pushing them onto the stack. It uses integer division and the `div` instruction to separate the digits.

7. The program then calls the `outputmessage` subroutine to display the message "SQUARE = ".

8. The `sprint` loop retrieves the digits from the stack, one by one, and prints them using the `print` subroutine.

9. Finally, the program calls the `printnewline` subroutine to print a newline character and then exits using the `int 0x80` system call.

### Example:

Let's run through an example of how the program works:

Suppose the user enters the two-digit number "25" as input.

1. The program will display the message "ENTER THE NUMBER (2 digit)".

2. The user inputs "25".

3. The `convert` subroutine converts the ASCII values of '2' and '5' into the numeric values 2 and 5, respectively.

4. The `sum` loop calculates the sum of 2 and 5, resulting in 7.

5. The `breakdigits` loop breaks down 7 into individual digits and pushes them onto the stack: '7'.

6. The `outputmessage` subroutine prints "SQUARE = ".

7. The `sprint` loop pops '7' from the stack and prints it.

8. The program prints a newline character.

9. The program exits.

Output:
```
ENTER THE NUMBER (2 digit)
25
SQUARE = 7
```

This program demonstrates basic input and output handling in x86 assembly language, along with numeric conversions and arithmetic operations. The program is designed to work with two-digit numbers, and its behavior is based on the user's input.

Make sure to assemble and run the code on an appropriate x86 assembly environment to observe the actual output.
