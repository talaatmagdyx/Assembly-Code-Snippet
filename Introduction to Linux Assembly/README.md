# Introduction to Linux Assembly Programming with Messages

This assembly program demonstrates a simple example of using Linux syscalls to display messages on the console. It prints three different messages using the `SYS_WRITE` syscall and then exits using the `SYS_EXIT` syscall. The provided code is designed to be assembled and executed on a Linux environment.

## Code Explanation

The assembly code performs the following steps:

1. **Displaying Messages** (`_start` section):
   - Uses the `SYS_WRITE` syscall to display the "Hello, programmers!" message.
   - Uses the same syscall to display the "Welcome to the world of," message.
   - Uses the syscall once again to display the "Linux assembly programming!" message.

2. **Exiting the Program**:
   - Uses the `SYS_EXIT` syscall to terminate the program.

## Example

Suppose you assemble and execute the provided assembly code on a Linux environment. The program will display the following messages in sequence:

1. "Hello, programmers!"
2. "Welcome to the world of,"
3. "Linux assembly programming!"

Example Output:
```
Hello, programmers!
Welcome to the world of,
Linux assembly programming!
```

In this example, the program successfully displays the messages using the `SYS_WRITE` syscall and then gracefully exits using the `SYS_EXIT` syscall.

## Usage

1. Ensure you are running this code on a Linux environment or emulator that supports the syscalls used in the code.
2. Assemble the code using an appropriate assembler (e.g., NASM) and linker (e.g., LD).
3. Run the assembled binary to execute the program.
4. Observe the output, which will display the provided messages in the order specified in the code.

**Note**: Assembly language can interact with system components. Make sure you understand the code before running it, especially when it involves system calls.
